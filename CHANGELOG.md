- **Code Modernization** - Updated version checking code to use current JavaScript standards and async/await patterns

## [1.3.0]

### üéâ New Features

## [1.2.3]

### üöë Patch Release
- **Release** - Bumped package.json and docs to 1.2.3 and created annotated git tag `v1.2.3`.
- **Docs** - Updated website links and cache-bust tokens to reference v1.2.3.

### üõ† Fixes & Stability
- **Cron scheduling reliability** - Ensured cron next-run calculations are performed in the main process and exposed via a secure `getNextTestTime` IPC in `preload.js`.
- **IPC contract** - `get-next-test-time` in `main.js` now returns a numeric timestamp (ms since epoch) and logs parsing success/failure; renderer converts the value to a Date.
- **Renderer resilience** - Updated `src/renderer/renderer.js` to call the main IPC asynchronously, handle unexpected responses, and fall back safely when necessary.
- **Cron parser compatibility** - Replaced incompatible `parser.parseExpression` usage with `CronExpressionParser.parse(...)` in `main.js` and `src/speedMonitor.js`.
- **Cron behavior** - Cron mode no longer runs an immediate test on start; it waits for the first scheduled occurrence.
- **Logging & diagnostics** - Added console logs to main to make cron parse failures visible at runtime; added a small node test during development to confirm the cron-parser API.

### üìù Notes
- If you still see "next test in 5 minutes" after upgrading, fully restart the Electron app to ensure the updated main process is running (old main process instances will continue to return the fallback).

## [1.2.2]

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Cron Scheduling** - Fixed cron next-run calculation by moving cron parsing to main process and using the correct cron-parser API
- **Cron Behavior** - Cron mode no longer runs an immediate test at startup; the first test runs at the next scheduled occurrence
- **Status Display** - Ensure status shows "Sleeping" when monitoring is active but waiting for next scheduled test; "Running" is shown only during an active test

### üîß Technical Fixes
- **Security/IPC** - Exposed a safe `getNextTestTime` IPC endpoint in the preload script for accurate next-run calculations from the renderer
- **API Compatibility** - Updated code to use `CronExpressionParser.parse(...)` to match the installed cron-parser API and avoid runtime errors
